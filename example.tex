\paragraph{}Check out \texttt{example.tex} for the contents of this section. This section will be commented out after a while.
\paragraph{}Here is a reference \cite{example2024}. An inline equation $x^2+1=0$, or in display form:
\[\int_0^1 f(x)\mathrm{d}x\]
see also the \texttt{equation, multline, align} environments from the \texttt{amsmath} package.
\paragraph{}A picture can be included using \texttt{includegraphics} (on Overleaf, one may simply use the snippet for begin figure) (see the next page):
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{media/coffee.jpg}
