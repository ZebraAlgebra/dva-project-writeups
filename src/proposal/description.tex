\section{Project Description}
\alertblock{comment}{Project Description Source}{The following is taken from Teams.}
\alertblock{todo}{Project Title}{We might have to think of a project title. This will be included in the document header; we can also include it in this section's header.}

\paragraph{Project Abstract.}Visualize author or book recommendations for user given a book title or author.
 
\paragraph{How is it done today; what are the limits of current practice?}Today, a user most likely Googles something along the lines of “what are books similar to [book title]” or “authors who are similar to [author name].” In looking for other approaches, I found \href{https://www.publishersmarketplace.com/bookscan/about.cgi}{Publisher’s Marketplace}, which shows sales information. There is \href{https://www.publishersmarketplace.com/bookscan/about.cgi}{literature-map} which shows author recommendations. \href{https://www.publishersmarketplace.com/bookscan/about.cgi}{Shepherd} is more analog in its approach of recommendations as they ask authors directly for recommendations. There is also \href{https://www.publishersmarketplace.com/bookscan/about.cgi}{Nathan Rooy’s Visual Book Recommender project} which clusters books on similarity.

The current approaches are good for the respective tasks they try to achieve; however, for a project like Nathan Rooy’s Visual Book Recommender, I believe we can improve the clustering algorithm of books, make the user interface more digestible, and improve the user’s search interaction.
 
\paragraph{What's new in your approach? Why will it be successful?} Our new approach is to make the visualization more sleek in terms of how much information is presented to the user. Maybe we can incorporate new datasets or different data sources to have a better recommendation algorithm.
 
\paragraph{Who cares?}Books are still one of the most popular ways to consume ideas and stories. This visualization approach can also be incorporated into apps like Kindle Books or Libby to help readers determine what book they might check out next. This will be a good complementary tool for any reader.
 
\paragraph{If you're successful, what difference and impact will it make, and how do you measure them (e.g., via user studies, experiments, ground truth data, etc.)?}If successful, the impact will be that more people will read for longer as hopefully they are able to find books they are interested in. If this is done in an app like Libby, then user engagement (read time) can be used as a measure of success.
 
\paragraph{What are the risks and payoffs?}The risks are there are a lot of books being published, especially in the age of self-publication, so we need to determine what is appropriate in terms of scope. The payoff is that this can be a very helpful interface that can be potentially scaled to all different product types like music, movies, plays, etc.

\paragraph{How much will it cost?}It should be low costs, but in a business setting we can consider hosting costs, potential licensing fees, and if there are relevant API fees.
 
\paragraph{How long will it take?}Two months.
 
\paragraph{What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?}Midterm would be that the data is all there and the recommendation algorithm seems reasonable. Final would be getting the visualization and interactivity portion finished.
 
\paragraph{How will progress be measured?}Progress will be measured in Trello.
